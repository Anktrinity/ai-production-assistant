- ** ⏰ Automated Jobs: 4 recurring cron tasks (daily health checks, hourly analysis, weekly cleanup, and alert maintenance)
- ** 💬 Slack Power: 5 core commands (/hackathon status, /hackathon create …, /hackathon gaps, /task …, @assistant) plus proactive reminders
- ** 🎨 Dashboard Size: ~500 lines of HTML/CSS hand-rolled into a real-time production command center
- ** ✅ Git Commits: 2 milestone commits anchoring the journey: one for the monitoring engine, another for the event-ready assistant
